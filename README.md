For my MSc in Econometrics & Management Science, specializing in Business Analytics & Quantitative Marketing at the Erasmus School of Economics in Rotterdam, I conducted a research project as part of the Computer Science course. The primary objective was to identify duplicate products within a large dataset of TV products, addressing scalability challenges. The approach involved employing Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) on a specific set of model words, followed by the application of Jaccard similarity and two clustering methods: k-means and hierarchical clustering.

The code is organized into two files: "Functions" and "main." Begin by running the "Functions" file to load all necessary functions. In the main code, start by installing required packages and importing and cleaning the data. Establish a list of keywords and construct a binary matrix by comparing the set of model words to each product's title, considering features. Transform this binary matrix into a signature matrix as input for LSH. Using the candidate pairs identified by LSH, apply Jaccard similarity to create a similarity matrix. Finally, employ clustering methods to identify potential duplicates, followed by an evaluation of the results.
